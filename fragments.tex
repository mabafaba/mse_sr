When we speak of ``complex patterns'' here, we mean patterns which could be described intuitively as having ``meaningful structural richness''.\cite{EnotComplex1}. This is clearly not the case in entirely random patterns (figure \ref{fig:synthetic} a). Randomised checker boards b)-d), are essentially fully random patterns ``zoomed in''. Arguably, the linearly sorted pattern e) is not structurally rich either. Potentially slightly more structurally rich might be pattern f), a random spatial distribution with linearly changing probability (\ref{fig:synthetic} e)). As an example of a ``complex'' pattern we \cite{cheng1999multifractality}
