  journal = {Geographical Analysis},
  year = {2010},
  volume = {42, 4},
  pages = {395–421},
  abstract = {Entropy measures were first introduced into geographical analysis
  during a period when the concept of human systems as being in some
  sort of equilibrium was in the ascendancy. In particular, entropy-maximising,
  in direct analogy to equilibrium statistical mechanics, provided
  a powerful framework in which to generate location and interaction
  models. This was introduced and popularised by Wilson (1970) and
  it led to many different extensions that filled in the framework
  rather than progressed it to different kinds of models. In particular,
  we review two such extensions here: how space can be introduced into
  the formulation through defining a ‘spatial entropy’ and how entropy
  can be decomposed and nested to capture spatial variation at different
  scales. Two obvious directions to this research, however, have remained
  implicit. First, the more substantive interpretations of the concept
  of entropy for different shapes and sizes of geographical systems
  have hardly been developed. Second, an explicit dynamics associated
  with generating probability distributions has not been attempted
  until quite recently with respect to the search for how power laws
  emerge as signatures of universality in complex systems. In short,
  the connections between entropy-maximising, substantive interpretations
  of entropy measures, and the longer term dynamics of how equilibrium
  distributions are reached and maintained have not been well-developed.
  This has many implications for future research and in conclusion,
  we will sketch the need for new and different entropy measures as
  well as new forms of dynamics that enable us to see how equilibrium
  spatial distributions can be generated as the outcomes of dynamic
  processes that converge to the steady state.},

  volume = {71},
  abstract = {In this paper, we define measures of urban diversity, density and
  segregation using new data and software systems based on GIS. These
  allow us to visualise the meaning of the multifunctional city. We
  begin with a discussion of how cities have become more segregated
  in their land uses and activities during the last 200 years and how
  the current focus is on reversing this trend through limiting urban
  sprawl and bringing new life back to the inner and central city.
  We define various indices which show how diversity and density manifest
  themselves spatially. We argue that multifunctionalism is a relative
  concept, dependent upon the spatial and temporal scale that we use
  to think about the mixing and concentration of urban land uses. We
  present three examples using spatially smoothed indicators of diversity:
  for a world city – London, for a highly controlled polycentric urban
  region – Randstad Holland, and for a much more diffusely populated
  semi-urban region – Venice-Padua-Teviso. We conclude by illustrating
  that urban diversity varies as people engage in different activities
  associated with different land uses throughout the day, as well as
  through the vertical, third dimension of the city. This impresses
  the point that we need to understand multifunctional cities in all
  their dimensions of space and time.},

  abstract = {Many complex networks erase parts of their geometry as they develop,
  so that their evolution is difficult to quantify and trace. Here
  we introduce entropy measures for quantifying the complexity of street
  orientations and length variations within planar networks and apply
  them to the street networks of 41 British cities, whose geometric
  evolution over centuries can be explored. The results show that the
  street networks of the old central parts of the cities have lower
  orientation/length entropies ­ the streets are more tightly ordered
  and form denser networks ­ than the outer and more recent parts.
  Entropy and street length increase, because of spreading, with distance
  from the network centre. Tracing the 400­year evolution of one network
  indicates growth through densification (streets are added within
  the existing network) and expansion (streets are added at the margin
  of the network) and a gradual increase in entropy over time},

  abstract = {This note is concerned with the measurement of racial integration
  of schools in a way that permits a simple aggregation of the measure
  to sets of schools such as school districts. [The procedure can be
  applied to institutions other than schools, but we prefer a more
  specific terminology.] There are several standard procedures for
  measuring integration, but the dissimilarity index appears to be
  more popular than any other index.‡ This index is based on a comparison
  of the number of white students in each school, measured as a fraction
  of the total number of white students in the city, and the analogous
  nonwhite proportion of the same school. The index is defined as one-half
  of the sum over all schools of the absolute differences of these
  proportions. The value of the index is zero when the racial compositions
  of all schools are identical and it takes larger and larger positive
  values (up to a maximum of 1) when the racial compositions are more
  different; also, it has a simple interpretation in terms of minimum
  shifts which are needed in order to obtain identical racial compositions
  in all schools. However, the use of absolute differences makes the
  dissimilarity index less suitable when one wants to aggregate schools
  to school districts.§ The objective of this note is to show that
  there are some simple measures derived from information theory which
  are superior in this respect, and to illustrate their use by means
  of data on the elementary schools of the Chicago public school system
  for the years 1963-1969.},

  abstract = {The assumption that travel demand is influenced by land use has long
  been applied in Dutch spatial planning policy. The aim of the present
  analysis is to explore how far this policy has succeeded in bringing
  about a compact and mixed spatial structure. Hence, a detailed analysis
  of the variation and development in the dispersal of urban activities,
  mix of uses, density, and diversity in urban areas between 1990 and
  1996 is pro- vided. It appears that although urban areas are leveling
  out on the one hand, they are undergoing a process of separation
  on the other. Although most of the building in the Randstad (the
  densely populated western part of the Netherlands) is taking place
  inside the designated urban regions, it is not producing compact
  monocentric towns; the urban areas are converging more and more,
  the metropolitan centers are losing their importance, and subcenters
  and concentrations of services are spring- ing up on the edges of
  the urban regions. These phenomena confirm the emergence of complex,
  polycentric urban areas. Suburban sprawl is increasing rapidly in
  the intermediate zone outside the Randstad, where low-density residential
  areas, monoenvironments, and business estates are expanding. This
  region appears to have become the suburban search space for the Randstad.
  These dual trends will increase the distance between locations and
  make destinations less easily accessible by bicycle and public transport.
  Hence, neither the polycentric development inside the Randstad nor
  the suburban developments outside the Randstad will contribute to
  the reduction of car use.},

abstract="The language of entropy is examined for consistency with its mathematics and physics, and for its efficacy as a guide to what entropy means. Do common descriptors such as disorder, missing information, and multiplicity help or hinder understanding? Can the language of entropy be helpful in cases where entropy is not well defined? We argue in favor of the descriptor spreading, which entails space, time, and energy in a fundamental way. This includes spreading of energy spatially during processes and temporal spreading over accessible microstates states in thermodynamic equilibrium. Various examples illustrate the value of the spreading metaphor. To provide further support for this metaphor's utility, it is shown how a set of reasonable spreading properties can be used to derive the entropy function. A main conclusion is that it is appropriate to view entropy's symbol S as shorthand for spreading.",

    abstract = { Of particular importance to the study of large-scale phenomena in physical geography is the modifiable areal unit problem (MAUP). While often viewed as only a problem in human geography (particularly demographic studies), the MAUP is an issue for all quantitative studies in geography of spatial phenomena (Openshaw and Taylor, 1979). Increasingly, remote sensing and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) are being used to assess the distribution of phenomena from a large scale. These phenomena are modelled using areal units that can take any shape or size resulting in complications with statistical analysis related to both the scale and method used to create the areal units. In this paper, we define the modifiable areal unit problem, present examples of when it is a problem in physical geography studies, and review some potential solutions to the problem. Our aim is to increase awareness of this complicated issue and to promote further discussion and interest in this topic. }

title="A review on the use of entropy in landscape ecology: heterogeneity, unpredictability, scale dependence and their links with thermodynamics",
journal="Landscape Ecology",
year="2015",
volume="30",
number="1",
pages="51--65",
abstract="The identification of a universal law that can predict the spatiotemporal structure of any entity at any scale has long been pursued. Thermodynamics have targeted this goal, and the concept of entropy has been widely applied for various disciplines and purposes, including landscape ecology. Within this discipline, however, the uses of the entropy concept and its underlying assumptions are various and are seldom described explicitly. In addition, the link between this concept and thermodynamics is unclear. The aim of this paper is to review the various interpretations and applications of entropy in landscape ecology and to sort them into clearly defined categories. First, a retrospective study of the concept genesis from thermodynamics to landscape ecology was conducted. Then, 50 landscape ecology papers that use or discuss entropy were surveyed and classified by keywords, variables and metrics identified as related to entropy. In particular, the thermodynamic component of entropy in landscape ecology and its various interpretations related to landscape structure and dynamics were considered. From the survey results, three major definitions (i.e., spatial heterogeneity, the unpredictability of pattern dynamics and pattern scale dependence) associated with the entropy concept in landscape ecology were identified. The thermodynamic interpretations of these definitions are based on different theories. The thermodynamic interpretation of spatial heterogeneity is not considered relevant. The thermodynamic interpretation related to scale dependence is also questioned by complexity theory. Only unpredictability can be thermodynamically relevant if appropriate measurements are used to test it.",
