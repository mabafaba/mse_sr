*** META
  - think. you are explaining to a  person
  - exaggerate and be clear
  - what does it mean? 
  - rejected by a physicist.
  - can be repetitive

** QUESTIONS

  - matrix indices
  - number of phase space dimensions

  - structure: results together

  - after eq: 7:: should this go to "common phase space definitions for spatial entropy" ?


** pick up
-abstract




  ** CHANGES
- WHAT YOU MEAN WITH SCALES NOT CLEAR


- introduction:
  first paragraph:
    - phrase stronger
    - after first sentence: what does it mean? evenness? make stronger

  - explain why complex systems: in context of the entropy im measuring, how

- batty "literature gap" into introduction
- non capital after colon

- "we show that the randomness in what people do.." instant reject; explain exactly what you are measuring

- paragraph in the introduction to explain exactly what I am measuring

- last paragraph of introduction needs to be extended to half a page:
    - explain very carefully what i measure
    - new definition of entropy for scales
    - introducing scales
    - experiments on simulation: how performs according to patterns
    - case study to show evolution in time
    - contrast traditional with new measure
    - in order to take use
    - last intro paragraph: very specific about how, and why the fully random case is not maximum entropy

- INTRO: ABSOLUTELY CLEAR WHY. I AM GOING TO SHOW THIS!
- 

- but don't say not "contrary to intuition" if its against the 


- "A multiscale approach to entropy in cities" summary longer

- "In thermodynamics, the word entropy refers to an agreed definition of the phase space unless stated otherwise." WEIRD.
..it is commonly understood in thermodynamics that if one refers to phase space, ... expand 


- figure 1 after figure 2

- fix "groups" phase space no longer groups but definitions.

- "None of the reviewed approaches simultaneously satisfy both main requirements that we identified above for a conceptually consistent interpretation of entropy that reflects the idea of cities as emergent phaenomena." AWKWARD: above, after what??? .. "we are interested into measures that reflect the idea that take into considerations" non of the just described
.. In contrast to the existing.. FIRST, and say how places are distributed ..

- SPATIAL DEPENDENCE: 
  - not clear; 
  - inside multiscale phase space as an example of why introducing scales
  - 


  - multiscale entropy phase space:
    - WHAT DO YOOU MEAN by different scales!! exactly
    - you haven't
    - relate to scales
    - But.. its all random??? 

* dont call spatial dependence
* put in multiscale entropy
* "Im going to illustrate with an example how in an urban system the scales are considered."" Before this talk about the different neighbourhoods

"DEVIL SAYS": BUT THE HIGHEST ENTROPY IS COMPLETELY RANDOM????
LINK: spatial dependence of places VS. multiple scales


- why different scales, what they mean; relate to questions




todo:
-multiscale entropy phasespace
-introduce: what I want to measure: individual in a city related to sclaes. what you mean by scales?
- THE INDIVIDUAL IN THE URBAN CONTEXT. 
- "IMPORTANT SENTENCE: I KNOW RANDOM WOULD BE MAXIMUM USUALLY"  
- But in this situation not measuring that. NOt geo, so Not spatially random
- what I mean by scales in the system? in the following an example, using two colors.... illustrate how scales are incorporated.

- introduce measure.

- define phase space
  - state as a set of characteristics according to all the characteristics

  - VECTORS ARE BOLD OR ARROW

f(x_i^{d_0},

x_^{dn}

PSEUDOCODE
points in space
x_i_{d0}
define state 

i+d indexing is nonesense
1. scalar 1 number
2. bold vector
3. matrix  greek letter PSY as the state of the 

?why similar


figure allrasters: a)b)c)d)e)
figure allrasters: year on X
figure allrasters:when is 1935? label years


-figure:multiscale results: NOT CONTINUOUS MEASURE: ADD POINTS!!!

- number of rounds in methodology
