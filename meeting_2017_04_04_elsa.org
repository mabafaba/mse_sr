* Questions to ask

  - matrix indices correct?
  - number of phase space dimensions in \Phi{...} ok?
  - structure: results together? method first?
  - text right after eq: 7:: should this part go to "common phase space definitions for spatial entropy" ?


* COMMENTS

** META
  - think. you are explaining to a person
  - exaggerate and be clear
  - what does it mean? 
  - rejected by a physicist 
  - repetitive is ok

** what we said to discuss later
 -abstract


** CHANGES
*** WHAT YOU MEAN WITH SCALES IS NOT CLEAR 

*** global
  - non capital after colon
  - don't say "groups of measures" as they are now "basic phase space definitions" 
  - "DEVIL SAYS": BUT THE HIGHEST ENTROPY IS COMPLETELY RANDOM????
  - LOGICAL LINK MISSING: spatial dependence of places VS. multiple scales
  - why different scales, what they mean; relate to questions

*** introduction:
  - first paragraph:
    - phrase stronger
    - after first sentence: what does it mean? evenness? make stronger
  - explain why complex systems: in context of the entropy im measuring, how
  - put batty "literature gap"... into introduction
- "we show that the randomness in what people do.." instant reject
- paragraph in the introduction to explain exactly what I am measuring
- last paragraph of introduction needs to be extended to half a page:
    - explain very carefully what i measure
    - new definition of entropy for scales
    - introducing scales
    - experiments on simulation: how performs according to patterns
    - case study to show evolution in time
    - contrast traditional with new measure
    - very specific about how, and why the fully random case is not maximum entropy
   - but don't say not "in contrary to intuition" 

*** A multiscale approach to entropy in cities
  -  summary longer
  - "In thermodynamics, the word entropy refers to an agreed definition of the phase space unless stated otherwise." WEIRD. 
     -> instead "..it is commonly understood in thermodynamics that if one refers to phase space..",
     - then expand more into specifics in thermodynamics 



  - "None of the reviewed approaches simultaneously satisfy both main requirements that we identified above for a conceptually consistent interpretation of entropy that reflects the idea of cities as emergent phaenomena." AWKWARD: above, after what??? .. "we are interested into measures that reflect the idea that take into considerations" non of the just described..
    - In contrast to the existing.. FIRST, and say how places are distributed ..

*** SPATIAL DEPENDENCE
  - not clear;
  - inside multiscale phase space as an example of why introducing scales
  - dont call it "spatial dependence" 


*** multiscale entropy phase space:
    - WHAT DO YOOU MEAN by different scales!! exactly
    - relate to scales
    - "But.. why is it not spatially random buhu ???" (everyone et. al., 2017)
    -  "Im going to illustrate with an example how in an urban system the scales are considered."" Before this talk about the different neighbourhoods







todo:
-multiscale entropy phasespace
-introduce: what I want to measure: individual in a city related to sclaes. what you mean by scales?
- THE INDIVIDUAL IN THE URBAN CONTEXT. 
- "IMPORTANT SENTENCE: I KNOW RANDOM WOULD BE MAXIMUM USUALLY"  
- But in this situation not measuring that. NOt geo, so Not spatially random
- what I mean by scales in the system? in the following an example, using two colors.... illustrate how scales are incorporated.

- introduce measure.

- define phase space
  - state as a set of characteristics according to all the characteristics

  - VECTORS ARE BOLD OR ARROW

f(x_i^{d_0},

x_^{dn}

PSEUDOCODE
points in space
x_i_{d0}
define state 

i+d indexing is nonesense
1. scalar 1 number
2. bold vector
3. matrix  greek letter PSY as the state of the 

?why similar

figure allrasters: year on X
figure allrasters:when is 1935? label years


-figure:multiscale results: NOT CONTINUOUS MEASURE: ADD POINTS!!!

- number of rounds in methodology
