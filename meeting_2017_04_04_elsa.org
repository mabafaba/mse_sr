* I'M CURRENTLY WORKING ON..
  - [X]  equation indices
  - [ ]  introduction 



* QUESTIONS [2/4]

  - [X] matrix indices correct?
  - [ ] number of phase space dimensions in \Phi{...} ok?
  - [X] structure: results together? method first?
  - [ ] text right after eq: 7:: should this part go to "common phase space definitions for spatial entropy" ?


* COMMENTS ELSA

** meta [0/5]
  - [ ] think. you are explaining to a person
  - [ ] exaggerate and be clear
  - [ ] what does it mean? 
  - [ ] rejected by a physicist 
  - [ ] repetitive is ok

** what we said to discuss later [0/1]
 - [ ] abstract


** requested changes

  *** global [0/6]
    - [ ] WHAT YOU MEAN WITH SCALES IS NOT CLEAR 
    - [ ] non capital after colon
    - [ ] don't say "groups of measures" as they are now "basic phase space definitions" 
    - [ ] "DEVIL SAYS": BUT THE HIGHEST ENTROPY IS COMPLETELY RANDOM????
    - [ ] LOGICAL LINK MISSING: spatial dependence of places VS. multiple scales
    - [ ] why different scales, what they mean; relate to questions

  *** introduction [1/7]
    - [ ] first paragraph:
      - [ ] phrase stronger
      - [ ] after first sentence: what does it mean? evenness? make stronger
    - [ ] explain why complex systems: in context of the entropy im measuring, how
    - [X] put batty "literature gap"... into introduction
    - [ ] "we show that the randomness in what people do.." instant reject
    - [ ] paragraph in the introduction to explain exactly what I am measuring
    - [ ] last paragraph of introduction needs to be extended to half a page:
      - [ ] explain very carefully what i measure
      - [ ] new definition of entropy for scales
      - [ ] introducing scales
      - [ ] experiments on simulation: how performs according to patterns
      - [ ] case study to show evolution in time
      - [ ] ontrast traditional with new measure
      - [ ] very specific about how, and why the fully random case is not maximum entropy
    - [ ] but don't say not "in contrary to intuition" 

  *** A multiscale approach to entropy in cities [0/3]

    - [ ] summary longer
    - [ ] "In thermodynamics, the word entropy refers to an agreed definition of the phase space unless stated otherwise." WEIRD. 
       -> instead "..it is commonly understood in thermodynamics that if one refers to phase space..",
       - then expand more into specifics in thermodynamics 

    - [ ] "None of the reviewed approaches simultaneously satisfy both main requirements that we identified above for a conceptually consistent interpretation of entropy that reflects the idea of cities as emergent phaenomena." AWKWARD: above, after what??? .. "we are interested into measures that reflect the idea that take into considerations" non of the just described..
      - In contrast to the existing.. FIRST, and say how places are distributed ..

  *** multiscale phase space [0/8]
    - [ ] introduce: what I want to measure: individual in a city related to sclaes. what you mean by scales?
    - [ ] THE INDIVIDUAL IN THE URBAN CONTEXT. 
    - [ ] "IMPORTANT SENTENCE: I KNOW RANDOM WOULD BE MAXIMUM USUALLY BUT..."  
      - [ ] But in this situation not measuring that. NOt geo, so Not spatially random
    - [ ] what I mean by scales in the system? in the following an example, using two colors.... illustrate how scales are incorporated.
    - [ ] WHAT DO YOOU MEAN by different scales!! exactly
    - [ ] relate to scales
    - [ ] "But.. why is it not spatially random buhu ???" (everyone et. al., 2017)
    -  [ ] "Im going to illustrate with an example how in an urban system the scales are considered."" Before this talk about the different neighbourhoods


  *** spatial dependence [0/3]
    - [ ] not clear;
    - [ ] inside multiscale phase space as an example of why introducing scales
    - [ ] dont call it "spatial dependence" 

  *** equations [4/6]
    - [X] vectors bold or with arrow
    - [x] fix d_0
    - [X] x_i^{dn}
    - [ ] TODO: PSEUDOCODE
    - [X] i+d indexing is nonesense
    - [X] define state: 
      -  1. scalar 1 number
      - 2. vector, multiple scales
      - 3. matrix  greek letter PSI




  *** results
    -  [ ] why ramdomised similar?
      - y-axis scale
      - patterns similar after 1935

*** discussion
  - fix incosistency caused by bits that moved to the introduction


  *** plots [0/6]
    - [ ] raster plots: a)b)c)d)e)
    - [ ] raster plots: years on X axis
    - [ ] raster plots:when is 1935? label years
    - [ ] multiscale results plot: NOT CONTINUOUS MEASURE: ADD POINTS!!!
    - [ ] number of runs for pvalues? -> methodology
    - [ ] figure 1 after figure 2
