* QUESTIONS [2/4]

  - [X] matrix indices correct?
  - [ ] number of phase space dimensions in \Phi{...} ok?
  - [X] structure: results together? method first?
  - [ ] text right after eq: 7:: should this part go to "common phase space definitions for spatial entropy" ?


* COMMENTS ELSA
** not sorted [10/15]

  - [X] We found an approach to a similar problem.. rewrite
    - [X] dont justify
    - phase space != physical space
    - scales
    - [X] other people “scales in entropy have been considered in time series… ”
    - not in configuration
  - definition of simple vs. complex?

  - [X] Boxcounting.. not there; in discussion after patterns (cascades. 
  - [X] time series should start from entropy at different scales..
    - [X] MOVE to “common phase space definitions”
  - paragraphs space
  - [X] “matrix 6” reference once then call PSI
  - [X] The most important simplification…. unclear. 
    - “we impose a further simplication of the sytem into the method, by defining a descrete set of values for all the elements in matrix PSI that will be given by  the bins obtained by the values after aggregation….”
  - [X] Example patterns = EXPERIMENTS : SIMULATED PATTERNS 
  - [X] transition sentence before examle patterns: in the following section we will

  - WHAT IS COMPLEX / WHAT IS SIMPLE??? 
    - patterns that smooth out
    - maybe not fractal? so can’t say fractal
    - HOW TO DEFINE COMPLEX?
    - the complexity of the pattern is condidered with respect to … 
    - simple where smooth out easily at different scales

  - figure: boxplot, random repititions, clear
  - [X] DATA: reference to supplementary information
  - [X] ENTROPY ESTIMATION: reference supplementary information
  - [X] null models not in results section

  - [ ] sensitivity : of course dependent on the framework, qualitatively not sensitive
  - [ ] Discussion: fractal stuff: Boxcounting etc. 
  - [ ] fractal organisation; hadrien’s paper

  - [ ] http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378437117300341

  - [ ] recommended references


** meta [0/5]
  - [ ] think. you are explaining to a person
  - [ ] exaggerate and be clear
  - [ ] what does it mean? 
  - [ ] rejected by a physicist 
  - [ ] repetitive is ok

** what we said to discuss later [0/1]
 - [ ] abstract


** requested changes

*** global [2/5]
  - [ ] WHAT YOU MEAN WITH SCALES IS NOT CLEAR 
  - [X] non capital after colon
  - [X] don't say "groups of measures" as they are now "basic phase space definitions" 
  - [ ] "DEVIL SAYS": BUT THE HIGHEST ENTROPY IS COMPLETELY RANDOM????
  - [ ] LOGICAL LINK MISSING: spatial dependence of places VS. multiple scales

*** introduction [8/8]
  - [X] explain entropy and how it relates to spatial evenness
  - [X] first paragraph:
    - [X] phrase stronger
    - [X] after first sentence: what does it mean? evenness? make stronger
  - [X] explain why complex systems: in context of the entropy im measuring, how
  - [X] put batty "literature gap"... into introduction
  - [X] "we show that the randomness in what people do.." instant reject
  - [X] paragraph in the introduction to explain exactly what I am measuring
  - [X] last paragraph of introduction needs to be extended to half a page:
    - [X] explain very carefully what i measure
    - [X] new definition of entropy for scales
    - [X] introducing scales
    - [X] experiments on simulation: how performs according to patterns
    - [X] case study to show evolution in time
    - [X] ontrast traditional with new measure
    - [X] very specific about how, and why the fully random case is not maximum entropy
  - [X] but don't say not "in contrary to intuition" 

*** A multiscale approach to entropy in cities [4/4]

  - [X] summary longer
  - [X] "In thermodynamics, the word entropy refers to an agreed definition of the phase space unless stated otherwise." WEIRD. 
     -> instead "..it is commonly understood in thermodynamics that if one refers to phase space..",
     - then expand more into specifics in thermodynamics 

  - [X] "None of the reviewed approaches simultaneously satisfy both main requirements that we identified above for a conceptually consistent interpretation of entropy that reflects the idea of cities as emergent phaenomena." AWKWARD: above, after what??? .. "we are interested into measures that reflect the idea that take into considerations" non of the just described..
  - [X] In contrast to the existing.. FIRST, and say how places are distributed ..

*** multiscale phase space [7/8]
  - [X] introduce: what I want to measure: individual in a city related to scales. what you mean by scales?
  - [X] THE INDIVIDUAL IN THE URBAN CONTEXT. 
  - [X] "IMPORTANT SENTENCE: I KNOW RANDOM WOULD BE MAXIMUM USUALLY BUT..."  
    - [X] But in this situation not measuring that. NOt geo, so Not spatially random
  - [X] what I mean by scales in the system? in the following an example, using two colors.... illustrate how scales are incorporated.
  - [X] WHAT DO YOOU MEAN by different scales!! exactly
  - [ ] relate to scales
  - [X] "But.. why is it not spatially random buhu ???" (everyone et. al., 2017)
  -  [X] "Im going to illustrate with an example how in an urban system the scales are considered."" Before this talk about the different neighbourhoods


*** spatial dependence [2/3]
  - [ ] not clear;
  - [X] inside multiscale phase space as an example of why introducing scales
  - [X] dont call it "spatial dependence" 

*** equations [5/6]
  - [X] vectors bold or with arrow
  - [x] fix d_0
  - [X] x_i^{dn}
  - [X] TODO: PSEUDOCODE
  - [X] i+d indexing is nonesense
  - [X] define state: 
    -  1. scalar 1 number
    - 2. vector, multiple scales
    - 3. matrix  greek letter PSI

*** results [/]
  -  [ ] why ramdomised similar?
    - y-axis scale
    - patterns similar after 1935

*** discussion
  - fix incosistency caused by bits that moved to the introduction


*** plots [0/6]
    - [ ] raster plots: a)b)c)d)e)
    - [ ] raster plots: years on X axis
    - [ ] raster plots:when is 1935? label years
    - [ ] multiscale results plot: NOT CONTINUOUS MEASURE: ADD POINTS!!!
    - [ ] number of runs for pvalues? -> methodology
    - [ ] figure 1 after figure 2
