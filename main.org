* ALL TO DO [1/11]


* meeting carlos & elsa
  [X] scalar characteristics: for example..


  [ ] MATRIX: equivalent to where xd0 is the local value of a characteristic of place i dn
xi itself.


  [ ] future work (discussion)
  [X]  no titles in acknowledgements
  [X] same superscript for same affiliation
  [X] Carlos name!
  [X] Clémentine

  [X] after colon no capital letters
  [ ] typos
  [X] entangelment different word: interdepence
  [ ] show how phase space is defined in the context
  [ ] to much emphasis "discuss interpretation"
  [X] uncertainty
  [X] symbol: \phi phase space
  [X] R^(N+1)*C 
  [X] Gibbs
  [X] R^N 
  [X] PSI 
  [X] define very clearly what is a state. : all possible values Psi
  [X] delete continuous.
  [ ] point directly supplementary material section
  [ ] further details ABOUT WHAT
  [ ] supplementary material in order it is talked about in paper.
  [ ] Methods and computation; Simulated patterns;
  [ ] schematic explanation: one pattern how computed, visual
  [ ] suppl mat. order

  [ ] don't start sentence with Then....

  [ ] figure captions left align
  [ ] figure 3 
  [ ] figure 2: sorted not by space
  [ ] how much places differ from each other... "favoured by a measure" is bad

  [ ] cities are the outcome of all the interactions... emergent patterns ... evolved to more complex ... high entropy!!!

  [ ] complexity patterns human 
  [ ] results: clear why decline
  [ ] don't mention confidence intervals
  [X] remove confidence intervals
  [ ] why is segregated higher entropy than random
  [ ] suppl no bold captions
  [ ] compact mixed etc. names 
  [ ] all legends too small!
  [X] remove URL's 
  [X] boltzman small somewhere

  [X] carlos 2nd; no doctors; 
  [ ] :authorship:
  [X] no asterisk in multiplications
  [ ]
