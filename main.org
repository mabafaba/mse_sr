//** SCIENTIFIC REPORT SUBMISSION GUIDELINES

* ASK ELSA
  - time series not well placed
  - combinatorical example necessary? 


* NOW
 - [ ] fix subheadings (plots)

* TO DO
<<<<<<< HEAD
  - [ ] phase space plots: axis labels not visible
  - [ ] results legend outside plot
=======
  - [ ] proof read: Pattern letters ok?
  - [ ] biases & sensitivities
  - [ ] geospace subheadings
  - [ ] geospace frequencies subheadings
>>>>>>> 6patterns
  - [ ] "black pixel frequencies" -> "black pixel probabilities"
  - [ ] figure 3 headings
  - [ ] phase space plot labels a-c
  - [ ] parameters of entropy estimation in synthetic data
  - [ ] say which log base in âˆ‘ p log p
  - [ ] make plots float
  - [ ] letters for plots
  - [ ] list of biases and sensitivities
  - [ ] sensitivity analysis?
      - [ ] half resolution
      - [ ] different (smaller if possible) or fewer radii

  - [ ] APPENDIX
    - [ ] data
      - [X] groups table
      - [ ] original data plot
      - [ ] summary
      - [X] selection bias
    - [ ] code description 


- [ ] GLOBAL
  - [ ] go through text again, fix grammar
  - [ ] rethink structure
  - [ ] link all numbers with sweave (regex search Rnw file for numbers)




*** BIASES
  - data selection for diversity
  - city edge
  - first outside, then inside
