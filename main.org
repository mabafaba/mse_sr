  - [X] say which log base in âˆ‘ p log p
  - [X] make plots float
  - [X] letters for plots
  - [ ] list of biases and sensitivities
  - [ ] sensitivity analysis decide parameters
      - [ ] half resolution
      - [ ] different (smaller if possible) or fewer radii

  - [ ] APPENDIX
    - [ ] data
      - [X] groups table
      - [ ] original data plot
      - [ ] summary
      - [X] selection bias
    - [ ] code description 


- [ ] GLOBAL
  - [ ] go through text again, fix grammar
  - [ ] rethink structure
  - [ ] link all numbers with sweave (regex search Rnw file for numbers)
  - [ ] proof read: Pattern letters ok?
  - [ ] all appendix referrenced?






** LATER
  - [ ] solve figure order. a) remove fig2 refs b) change order
  - [ ] Leibovichi ::: http://s3.amazonaws.com/academia.edu.documents/6823842/DL_2009COSIT09_LNCS.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAIWOWYYGZ2Y53UL3A&Expires=1491864076&Signature=OcQuu%2BA1G5P0UhC7bax77gEUXeA%3D&response-content-disposition=inline%3B%20filename%3DDefining_spatial_entropy_from_multivaria.pdf
      - [ ] read
      - [ ] understand
      - [ ] add
  - [ ] always log base 2



* NOT ACTIONABLE (NEEDS SPLITTING)
  - [ ] make it nice for the archive
  - [ ] biases & sensitivities




** REQUIRES INFO
